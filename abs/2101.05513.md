## Main idea

This is a direct extension of [Matt Hastings' paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07047), extended to the p=2 case. Here, QAOA does not offer quantum advantage, even against local algorithms.

## Concepts
* The high girth condition simplifies the analysis.
* local = each node computes its own spin knowing only its neighborhood (distributed algorithm)
* The quantum performance analysis is a direct calculation, similar to [this NASA Ames paper](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022304)
