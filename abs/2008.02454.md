## Main idea
We introduce a neat trick to enable the execution of convolution operations in the form of efficient, scaled, sum-pooling components. We present a Structural Regularization loss that enables this decomposition with negligible performance loss. Our method is competitive with other tensor decomposition and structured pruning methods.


## Background
Deep neural networks deliver outstanding performance across a variety of use-cases but quite often fail
to meet the computational budget requirements of mainstream devices. Hence, model efficiency plays
a key role in bridging deep learning research into practice. Various model compression techniques
rely on a key assumption that the deep networks are over-parameterized, meaning that a significant
proportion of the parameters are redundant. This redundancy can appear either explicitly or implicitly.
In the former case, several structured, as well as unstructured, pruning methods
have been proposed to systematically remove redundant components in the network and improve
run-time efficiency. On the other hand, tensor-decomposition methods based on singular values of
the weight tensors, such as spatial SVD or weight SVD, remove somewhat implicit elements of the
weight tensor to construct low-rank decompositions for efficient inference.

In this work, we explore restricting the degrees of freedom of convolutional kernels by imposing
a structure on them. This structure can be thought of as constructing the convolutional kernel by
super-imposing several constant-height kernels. A few examples are shown in Fig. 1 of the paper, where a kernel
is constructed via superimposition of M linearly independent masks with associated constant scalars
αm, hence leading to M degrees of freedom for the kernel. The very nature of the basis elements as
binary masks enables efficient execution of the convolution operation as explained in Sec. 3.1 of the paper.


## Results
By applying our method to a wide range of CNN architectures,
we demonstrate ‘structured’ versions of the ResNets that are up to 2× smaller
and a new Structured-MobileNetV2 that is more efficient while staying within
an accuracy loss of 1% on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. We also show
similar structured versions of EfficientNet on ImageNet and HRNet architecture
for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. Our method performs equally
well or superior in terms of the complexity reduction in comparison to the existing
tensor decomposition and channel pruning methods.
