new idea: "Spanning Tree QAOA" which starts from an approximate classical solution (one round) and then approaches the exact result as the number of rounds increases.

Focused on "Signed Maxcut" which can be solved by searching through spanning trees.

It has 3 parameters per round, and two rounds of ST-QAOA can one round of QAOA.

There is also a numerical comparison.
