Combinatorial designs are different than unitary designs.

Unitary designs are about splitting up U(n) into a "balanced" finite subset. This helps mimic random choices of unitary.

This approach uses Gelfand pairs: $$U(n) \to U(m) \times U(n-m)$$

The Clifford group is an exact unitary 3-design.

This is based on representation theory. The design is found inductively "from zeros of zonal spherical functions of the complex Grassmanian". The Grassmanian parameterizes k-dimensional linear subspaces of a n-dimensional vector space (i.e. like the Gelfand pairs above)

The constructions can be extremely large: $$5^4$$ for $$U(2)$$; $$5^{36}$$ for $$U(4)$$...

JP talked about qutrits and Bloch sphere extensions. You can still construct the Bloch sphere, but not every point in the sphere is a valid qutrit. It's related to purity. The  $$2^N -1$$ -dimensional ball is full from radius $$1/N$$ to $$1/(N-1)$$, but from then to $$1$$ it is not always full. (For qutrits, $$N=3$$, so it's only full from radius $$1/3$$ to $$1/2$$.)
