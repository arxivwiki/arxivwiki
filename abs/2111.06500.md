## Main idea
We propose a tiny deep network of which partial layers are recursively exploited for refining its previous estimations. During its iterative refinements, we employ learned gating criteria to decide whether to exit from the weight-sharing loop, allowing per-sample adaptation in our model. We also predict and exploit uncertainty estimations in the gating mechanism.


## Background
While hand pose estimation is a critical component of most interactive extended reality and gesture recognition systems, contemporary approaches are not optimized for computational and memory efficiency.


## Results
With the proposed setting,
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 2D/3D
hand pose estimation approaches in terms of both accuracy
and efficiency for widely used benchmarks.
