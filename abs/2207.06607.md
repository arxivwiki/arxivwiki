## Main idea
Qubit-qubit coupling can be mediated by introducing a tunable coupler made of tunable parameters. In this work the authors design a hybrid technique for couping qubits that is modular and alos mantains the high coherence of the system.


## Background
The two main ways to build coupling involve galvanically connecting or capacatively coupling qubits. The galvanic style could introduce extra degrees of freedom while the capavative style usually needs to be designed for the specific device making it rigid.

## Results
The coupling circuitry consists of two transmon qubits, each coupled to the one of the two qubits of interest. The two intermediary transmons are inductively coupled with a Josephson junction. The main features extracts from this design are the high degree of modularity, the coupling can be tuned to be off when needed, and the main qubit frequencies are weakly sensitive to the tuning of the coupler paramters leading to high coherence.
