## Background
In this work we propose a generalization of the matrix-valued hypercontractive inequality from Ben-Aroya, Regev, de Wolf to large alphabets. This was done by first generalizing the powerful 2-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb. We then study a few different applications of such hypercontractive inequality.


## Results
\begin{itemize}
\item We present an exponential lower bound $N = e^{\Omega(n/r^4)}$ on the size $N$ of locally decodable codes on $\mathbb{Z}_r^n \to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$.
\item We present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem when defined over large alphabets, which generalizes the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem.
\end{itemize}

The results on the Hidden Hypermatching problem have application on lower bounds for streaming algorithms. Here we focused on streaming algorithms that approximate the value of Unique Games on a $t$-hyperedge hypergraph. Using our hardness results for the Hidden Hypermatching problem, we showed that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving any nontrivial level of approximation requires $\Omega(n^{1−1/t})$ classical space or $\Omega(n^{1−2/t})$ quantum space.
