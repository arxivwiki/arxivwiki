## Main idea

* Defines (!!) the complexity class *NISQ*: BPP plus access to a quantum device with constant amount of depolarizing noise
* Oracle separations are a cute way to show that BPP != NISQ, and NISQ != BQP
* There are oracle problems in NISQ that are not in BPP, and problems not in NISQ but in BPP with noiseless, bounded depth quantum computation!

KM: I think extensions to this work might be a little contrived; but I think it is a smart idea to study the canonical problems (Simon's, Bernstein-Vazirani, etc) on noisy quantum devices.
