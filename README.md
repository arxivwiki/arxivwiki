Welcome to the arXiv wiki. Anything that could accompany an arXiv paper belongs here:

* a high-level summary
* links to talks and presentations
* informal explanations of core concepts
* comments

If you'd like to contribute, click the "Edit" button in the top right. Once your first change is approved, you'll receive access to make further changes and invite others.

I hope this becomes a useful resource for all kinds of researchers, especially those getting started in a new field.
