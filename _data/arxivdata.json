Previous quantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g. quantum amplitude and phase estimation) require error rates that are too low for near-term implementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available quantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum devices, reducing measurement number and runtime compared to the standard sampling method of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

This technique speeds up a central component of many quantum algorithms, with applications including chemistry, materials, finance, and beyond.

This circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has given rise to unprecedented single-photon detectors and a quantum computer supreme to the classical supercomputers in a certain task. Thermal sensors are appealing in enhancing these devices since they are not plagued by quantum noise and are smaller, simpler, and consume about six orders of magnitude less power than the commonly used traveling-wave parametric amplifiers.

The algorithm takes as input an $n$-qubit product state $|v\\rangle$ with mean energy $e_0=\\langle v|H|v\\rangle$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}=\\langle v|(H-e_0)^2|v\\rangle$, and outputs a state with an energy that is lower than $e_0$ by an amount proportional to $\\mathrm{Var}^2/n$. In a typical case, we have $\\mathrm{Var}=\\Omega(n)$ and the energy improvement is proportional to the number of edges in the graph. When applied to an initial random product state, we recover and generalize the performance guarantees of known algorithms for bounded-occurrence classical constraint satisfaction problems. We extend our results to $k$-local Hamiltonians and entangled initial states.","authors":"Anurag Anshu, David Gosset, Karen J.

This test has lead to several cryptographic applications. In particular, it has been applied to producing certifiable randomness from a single untrusted quantum device, self-testing a single quantum device and device-independent quantum key distribution. In this paper, we show that this test of quantumness, and essentially all the above applications, can actually be implemented by a very weak class of quantum circuits: constant-depth quantum circuits combined with logarithmic-depth classical computation.

Our framework relates quantum cost gradient operators, derived from the cost and mixing Hamiltonians, to classical cost difference functions that reflect cost function neighborhood structure. By considering QAOA circuits from the Heisenberg picture, we derive exact general expressions for expectation values as series expansions in the algorithm parameters, cost gradient operators, and cost difference functions. This enables novel interpretability and insight into QAOA behavior in various parameter regimes. For single- level QAOA1 we show the leading-order changes in the output probabilities and cost expectation value explicitly in terms of classical cost differences, for arbitrary cost functions. This demonstrates that, for sufficiently small positive parameters, probability flows from lower to higher cost states on average. By selecting signs of the parameters, we can control the direction of flow. We use these results to derive a classical random algorithm emulating QAOA1 in the small-parameter regime, i.e., that produces bitstring samples with the same probabilities as QAOA1 up to small error. For deeper QAOAp circuits we apply our framework to derive analogous and additional results in several settings. In particular we show QAOA always beats random guessing. We describe how our framework incorporates cost Hamiltonian locality for specific problem classes, including causal cone approaches, and applies to QAOA performance analysis with arbitrary parameters. We illuminate our results with a number of examples including applications to QUBO problems, MaxCut, and variants of MaxSat. We illustrate the application to QAOA circuits using mixing unitaries beyond the transverse-field mixer through two examples of constrained optimization, Max Independent Set and Graph Coloring.","authors":"Stuart Hadfield, Tad Hogg, Eleanor G.

Typical learnable quantization schemes [PACT, LSQ] assume unsigned quantization for activations and quantize all negative activations to zero which leads to significant loss in performance. Naively using signed quantization to accommodate these negative values requires an extra sign bit which is expensive for low-bit (2-, 3-, 4-bit) quantization. To solve this problem, we propose LSQ+, a natural extension of LSQ, wherein we introduce a general asymmetric quantization scheme with trainable scale and offset parameters that can learn to accommodate the negative activations. Gradient-based learnable quantization schemes also commonly suffer from high instability or variance in the final training performance, hence requiring a great deal of hyper-parameter tuning to reach a satisfactory performance. LSQ+ alleviates this problem by using an MSE-based initialization scheme for the quantization parameters. We show that this initialization leads to significantly lower variance in final performance across multiple training runs. Overall, LSQ+ shows state-of-the-art results for EfficientNet and MixNet and also significantly outperforms LSQ for low-bit quantization of neural nets with Swish activations (e.g.: 1.8% gain with W4A4 quantization and upto 5.6% gain with W2A2 quantization of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet dataset). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to quantize such architectures to extremely low bit-widths.","authors":"Yash Bhalgat, Jinwon Lee, Markus Nagel, Tijmen Blankevoort, Nojun Kwak"},"2003.00075":{"title":"Learned Threshold Pruning","abstract":"This paper presents a novel differentiable method for unstructured weight pruning of deep neural networks. Our learned-threshold pruning (LTP) method learns per-layer thresholds via gradient descent, unlike conventional methods where they are set as input. Making thresholds trainable also makes LTP computationally efficient, hence scalable to deeper networks. For example, it takes $30$ epochs for LTP to prune ResNet50 on ImageNet by a factor of $9.1$. This is in contrast to other methods that search for per-layer thresholds via a computationally intensive iterative pruning and fine-tuning process. Additionally, with a novel differentiable $L_0$ regularization, LTP is able to operate effectively on architectures with batch-normalization. This is important since $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties lose their regularizing effect in networks with batch-normalization. Finally, LTP generates a trail of progressively sparser networks from which the desired pruned network can be picked based on sparsity and performance requirements. These features allow LTP to achieve competitive compression rates on ImageNet networks such as AlexNet ($26.4\\times$ compression with $79.1\\%$ Top-5 accuracy) and ResNet50 ($9.1\\times$ compression with $92.0\\%$ Top-5 accuracy).

Current dark matter searches operating at microwave frequencies use a resonant cavity to coherently accumulate the field sourced by the dark matter and a near standard quantum limited (SQL) linear amplifier to read out the cavity signal. To further increase sensitivity to the dark matter signal, sub-SQL detection techniques are required. Here we report the development of a novel microwave photon counting technique and a new exclusion limit on hidden photon dark matter. We operate a superconducting qubit to make repeated quantum non-demolition measurements of cavity photons and apply a hidden Markov model analysis to reduce the noise to 15.7 dB below the quantum limit, with overall detector performance limited by a residual background of real photons. With the present device, we perform a hidden photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to $\\epsilon \\leq 1.68 \\times 10^{-15}$ in a band around 6.011 GHz (24.86 $\\mu$eV) with an integration time of 8.33 s. This demonstrated noise reduction technique enables future dark matter searches to be sped up by a factor of 1300. By coupling a qubit to an arbitrary quantum sensor, more general sub-SQL metrology is possible with the techniques presented in this work.","authors":"Akash V.

While two-body interactions underlie most natural phenomena, three- and four-body interactions are important for the physics of nuclei [1], exotic few-body states in ultracold quantum gases [2], the fractional quantum Hall effect [3], quantum error correction [4], and holography [5, 6]. Recently, a number of artificial quantum systems have emerged as simulators for many-body physics, featuring the ability to engineer strong interactions. However, the interactions in these systems have largely been limited to the two-body paradigm, and require building up multi-body interactions by combining two-body forces. Here, we demonstrate a pure N-body interaction between microwave photons stored in an arbitrary number of electromagnetic modes of a multimode cavity. The system is dressed such that there is collectively no interaction until a target total photon number is reached across multiple distinct modes, at which point they interact strongly. The microwave cavity features 9 modes with photon lifetimes of $\\sim 2$ ms coupled to a superconducting transmon circuit, forming a multimode circuit QED system with single photon cooperativities of $\\sim10^9$. We generate multimode interactions by using cavity photon number resolved drives on the transmon circuit to blockade any multiphoton state with a chosen total photon number distributed across the target modes. We harness the interaction for state preparation, preparing Fock states of increasing photon number via quantum optimal control pulses acting only on the cavity modes. We demonstrate multimode interactions by generating entanglement purely with uniform cavity drives and multimode photon blockade, and characterize the resulting two- and three-mode W states using a new protocol for multimode Wigner tomography.","authors":"Srivatsan Chakram, Kevin He, Akash V.

These unique capabilities motivate bringing mechanical devices into the quantum domain by interfacing them with engineered quantum circuits. Proposals to combine microwave-frequency mechanical resonators with superconducting devices suggest the possibility of powerful quantum acoustic processors. Meanwhile, experiments in several mechanical systems have demonstrated quantum state control and readout, phonon number resolution, and phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions. Currently, these acoustic platforms lack processors capable of controlling multiple mechanical oscillators' quantum states with a single qubit, and the rapid quantum non-demolition measurements of mechanical states needed for error correction. Here we use a superconducting qubit to control and read out the quantum state of a pair of nanomechanical resonators. Our device is capable of fast qubit-mechanics swap operations, which we use to deterministically manipulate the mechanical states. By placing the qubit into the strong dispersive regime with both mechanical resonators simultaneously, we determine the resonators' phonon number distributions via Ramsey measurements. Finally, we present quantum tomography of the prepared nonclassical and entangled mechanical states. Our result represents a concrete step toward feedback-based operation of a quantum acoustic processor.","authors":"E. Alex Wollack, Agnetta Y. Cleland, Rachel G.

Here we propose a modular and internally-tunable coupling architecture that can provide fast and robust linear coupling for several superconducting qubit modalities. The coupling mechanism is mediated by flux-controlled interference in a three-junction dcSQUID and is compatible with the high-fidelity implementation of a variety of functionalities, including two-qubit gate operations, parametric coupling, and quantum bus interfacing.","authors":"Daniel L.

To model existing devices, we assume the device can (1) noisily initialize all qubits, (2) apply many noisy quantum gates, and (3) perform a noisy measurement on all qubits. We first give evidence that $\\textsf{BPP}\\subsetneq \\textsf{NISQ}\\subsetneq \\textsf{BQP}$, by demonstrating super-polynomial oracle separations among the three classes, based on modifications of Simon's problem. We then consider the power of $\\textsf{NISQ}$ for three well-studied problems.

In this article we implement a rigorous direct comparison between QA on D-Wave hardware and QAOA on IBMQ hardware. These two quantum algorithms are also compared against classical simulated annealing. The studied problems are instances of a class of Ising models, with variable assignments of $+1$ or $-1$, that contain cubic $ZZZ$ interactions (higher order terms) and match both the native connectivity of the Pegasus topology D-Wave chips and the heavy hexagonal lattice of the IBMQ chips. The novel QAOA implementation on the heavy hexagonal lattice has a CNOT depth of $6$ per round and allows for usage of an entire heavy hexagonal lattice. Experimentally, QAOA is executed on an ensemble of randomly generated Ising instances with a grid search over $1$ and $2$ round angles using all 127 programmable superconducting transmon qubits of ibm_washington. The error suppression technique digital dynamical decoupling is also tested on all QAOA circuits. QA is executed on the same Ising instances with the programmable superconducting flux qubit devices D-Wave Advantage_system4.1 and Advantage_system6.1 using modified annealing schedules with pauses. We find that QA outperforms QAOA on all problem instances. We also find that dynamical decoupling enables 2-round QAOA to marginally outperform 1-round QAOA, which is not the case without dynamical decoupling.","authors":"Elijah Pelofske, Andreas Bärtschi, Stephan Eidenbenz"},"cs/9811023":{"title":"Complexity limitations on quantum computation","abstract":"We use the powerful tools of counting complexity and generic oracles to help understand the limitations of the complexity of quantum computation.
